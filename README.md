# LinearRegression_HigherOrderTerms
In this piece of code we are purposely overfitting and underfitting our data to understand how to reproduce the issue. The reason for this is because when you understand how to reproduce an error; you will understand how to avoid the error as well. The dataset can be received from "https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/lls/data/LINKS/v-Filip.shtml"
